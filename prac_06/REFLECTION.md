# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have utilised the Programming Patterns page more when I have forgotten what the best practice is. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I probably still need to take the time to practice using any new techniques more so I can understand it better and do less guesswork. For example using the console more would help.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel I am able to mostly adhere to the naming and layout conventions correctly

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to focus more on my commenting and docstrings as I usually do not include many or any, leading to code that is difficult to interpret what its purpose is.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Perhaps explain the git and github parts of pracs in better detail. There were a few times when I got lost when trying to follow the instructions due to something a program getting updated.
