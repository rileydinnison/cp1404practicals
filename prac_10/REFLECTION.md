# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My accuracy was mostly accurate with the estimates. They were mostly pretty close, usually being 10-20 mins off on average 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I noticed that my estimate accuracy got less accurate overtime as I started to underestimate the difficulty of them

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that some tasks can definitely be misleading in how difficult it some of them would be and how long it would take to do them.
I did learn that reading the whole task first and reading all the steps, then attempting the task helped compared to just following along
without reading it all first.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that I definitely needed to work on my docstrings as it was a reoccurring problem I had of forgetting them.
It also helped point out other small mistakes like incorrect naming conventions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt that it really helps catch small mistakes you would otherwise miss yourself. Something as simple as missing a docstring
or incorrectly naming something can be spotted a lot easier with a fresh pair of eyes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 07 Code Review](https://github.com/ProbbieO/cp1404practicals/pull/2#issuecomment-3538700486)

### Explanation

This code was overall very clean so it was difficult to point and find anything that could be improved on. That being said
it did teach me to still leave encouraging comments and tell them that they did a good job. The few errors was an extra
call to main in one of the programs and reminding them that commiting after small milestones is important.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 09 Code Review](https://github.com/manishankar-0208/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

This code was once again done extremely well and did not have too much to comment on. I thought the couple suggestions I gave,
while minor, were decent and would help improve the code. I did notice that they had uploaded some unnecessary files and thought
it was helpful to point that out so they could hopefully avoid the problem in the future. When I didn't have anything to comment on, I usually praise the
work to help encourage and show that they were doing well.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I think some more explanation in some of the pracs could definitely benefit the experience. There were several
places like the lastest prac using flask where it felt a little underexplained and was difficult to figure out
what I was meant to do. Having more hints or introducing less new topics in the Do-it-Yourself sections would definitely
help

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I felt that I was able to definitely hone down on my bad habits and really improve my bad coding habits near the end.
Something simple as remembering doc strings or getting better with naming was definitely an improvement I saw in my work.
